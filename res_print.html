<p class="pg2">I had worked at a job called urban planning twice this summer. During my first year, I had to go around interviewing people about the extreme heat crisis going on and recording heat temperature data near parks, parking lots, and bus stops. During the second year, I and other second years were part of a group called urban designers. This is because unlike the first years this time, we were going to design a cooling pocket park design that will be near Roxbury Community College that entails more interviews and a lot of planning, brainstorming and decisions.</p>
<p class="pg2">After my second year of urban planning ended, they gave all the second years an internship to take apart from my internship was with the ABC, also known as A Better City. While working at A Better City, they made me look at some research that was conducted in Boston. One of these were called the urban doom loop and city of Boston heat plan not just that, but I went on trips to the BU/Boston University to see their new thermal heating structure that will be green in energy and Boston Medical Center to see their rooftop garden.</p>
